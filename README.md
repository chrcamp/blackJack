# blackJack
First Python project

## Use Python3 to run.

Outstanding:
# figure out a way to make the Ace value dynamic--i.e. 1 or 11
# Blackjack is worth 1.5 times bet.
# consider split() double() functions
# add a high score tracker (write to csv or xlsx). record nbr of rounds played & highest wallet

# long-term: learn a python gui --probably pygame or tkinter-- and migrate.
