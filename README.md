## Use Python3 to run
First Python project.

Outstanding:
Refine evaluate() function with better dynamic Ace logic.
consider split() double() functions
add a high score tracker (write to csv or xlsx). record nbr of rounds played & highest wallet

long-term: learn a python gui --probably pygame or tkinter-- and migrate.
